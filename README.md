> [!TIP]
> This repository is forever evolving, and might change drastically as time goes on

> [!NOTE]
> I'm trying out [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/book/installation.html#package-managers), so I've moved zsh to its own folder
> 
> Currently, the Ansible automated setup is only configured to setup Nu & related tools
> 
> For example: FNM instead of NVM for node management, due to Nushell being non-POSIX & Rust-first

> [!WARNING]
> This repository is currently customised, and setup for Ubuntu 22.04 based Linux environments
> 
> For support of non-Ubuntu based environments, please contribute
